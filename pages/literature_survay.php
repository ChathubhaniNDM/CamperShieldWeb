        <p class="justify-p">
          Outdoor recreational activities, such as camping, picnicking, and forest exploration, offer individuals opportunities to immerse themselves in nature and escape the hustle and bustle of urban life [1]. In addition to offering a sense of renewal and relaxation, these activities are also quite informative, especially for people who are interested in outdoor survival skills and environmental protection [2].
          However, as with any outdoor excursion, camping and picnicking come with inherent challenges and risks that can compromise the safety and enjoyment of participants [3]. The availability of shallow water sources for bathing, interactions with wild animals, difficulties erecting tents safely and effectively, and the requirement to discern between edible and toxic mushrooms are some of the most urgent issues that campers face [4].
        </p>
        <p class="justify-p">
          Utilizing technology to overcome these obstacles and improve campers' and picnickers' outdoor experiences has gained popularity in recent years [5]. Mobile applications, in particular, have emerged as a promising tool for providing real-time information, guidance, and support to outdoor enthusiasts [6] [7].
        </p>
        <p class="justify-p">
          One area of innovation is the development of mobile applications equipped with features such as selecting suitable water source for bathing, animal threat detection, tent setting support, and mushroom identification. This application harnesses advanced technologies including image recognition, Random forest classifier [8], and CNN machine learning algorithm [9] to empower users with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate the outdoors safely and responsibly.
        </p>
        <p class="justify-p">
          Even though these technological solutions may have advantages, thorough assessment is still necessary. and validation to ensure their effectiveness, reliability, and usability in real-world camping scenarios [10]. In addition, when designing and implementing these applications, accessibility, inclusivity, and environmental sustainability must be considered [11].
        </p>
        <p class="justify-p">
          In summary, the integration of modern technology into outdoor activities holds great promise for enhancing the safety, enjoyment, and educational value of camping and picnicking experiences. However, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of these technological interventions and to address any potential challenges or limitations they may present.
